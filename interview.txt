1. What is TypeScript?
Answer: TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and other features
to help developers write more robust and maintainable code. It compiles to plain JavaScript
 and can be used in any JavaScript environment.

2. What are the advantages of using TypeScript over JavaScript?
Answer:

Static Typing: Helps catch errors at compile time.
Better Tooling: Enhanced IDE support with autocompletion and type checking.
Interfaces and Generics: Promotes code reusability and structure.
Class-Based Object-Oriented Programming: Supports modern OOP features.

3. Explain the concept of interfaces in TypeScript.
Answer: Interfaces in TypeScript define the shape of an object.
They specify what properties and methods an object should have without implementing them.
Interfaces are useful for type-checking and ensuring that classes or objects conform to a specific structure.

typescript

Copy
interface User {
    name: string;
    age: number;
}

const user: User = {
    name: "Alice",
    age: 30,
};

4. What is type inference in TypeScript?
Answer: Type inference is the ability of TypeScript to automatically determine the type of
a variable based on its initial value. This reduces the need for explicit type annotations.

typescript

Copy
let count = 10; // TypeScript infers count as number

5. How do you define a generic type in TypeScript?
Answer: Generics allow you to create reusable components that can work with any data type.
You define a generic type using angle brackets (<>).

typescript

Copy
function identity<T>(arg: T): T {
    return arg;
}

6. What are tuples in TypeScript?
Answer: Tuples are a type that represents an array with a fixed number of elements,
where each element can have a different type.

typescript

Copy
let tuple: [string, number] = ["Alice", 30];

7. Explain the difference between interface and type.
Answer:

Interface: Primarily used for defining object shapes. Supports declaration merging.
Type: Can define any type, including primitives, unions, and intersections. It cannot be merged.

8. What are access modifiers in TypeScript?
Answer: Access modifiers control the visibility of class members. The three modifiers are:

public: Accessible from anywhere (default).
private: Accessible only within the class.
protected: Accessible within the class and its subclasses.

9. What is the purpose of the never type?
Answer: The never type represents values that never occur. It is often used for
functions that throw errors or have infinite loops.

typescript

Copy
function throwError(message: string): never {
    throw new Error(message);
}
 
10. How do you handle optional properties in TypeScript?
Answer: Optional properties are defined using a question mark (?) after the property name
in an interface or type.

typescript

Copy
interface User {
    name: string;
    age?: number; // age is optional
}

Conclusion
These questions cover a range of fundamental TypeScript concepts that are commonly discussed in interviews.
Preparing detailed answers and examples can help you demonstrate your knowledge effectively.

        if (arr1[i] < arr2[j]) {
            merged.push(arr1[i++]);
        } else {
            merged.push(arr2[j++]);
        }
    }

    return merged.concat(arr1.slice(i)).concat(arr2.slice(j));
}

console.log(mergeSortedArrays([1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6])); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

Conclusion
These programming questions test fundamental algorithmic skills and problem-solving abilities.
 Practicing these types of problems can help you prepare for coding interviews effectively.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is Type Assertion?
Type assertion is a way to tell the TypeScript compiler, "I know this variable is of this type."
It helps you get more specific about the type of a variable when the compiler isn't sure.

When to Use It?
When you know the type of a variable better than TypeScript does.
To access properties or methods of a specific type.
How to Use Type Assertion
There are two main ways:

Using as:
typescript

Copy
let value: unknown = "Hello";
let length: number = (value as string).length; // Treats value as a string

Using Angle Bracket Syntax:
typescript

Copy
let value: unknown = "Hello";
let length: number = (<string>value).length; // Also treats value as a string
Example
typescript

Copy
interface User {
    name: string;
    age: number;
}

const userData: any = { name: "Alice", age: 30 };

// Assert userData as User type
const user = userData as User;

console.log(user.name); // Outputs: Alice
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In TypeScript, a union type allows you to define a variable that can hold multiple types.
This is particularly useful when you want to accept different types of values for a variable
or a function parameter.

How to Define a Union Type
You define a union type using the pipe (|) symbol. Here’s how it works:

typescript

Copy
let value: string | number; // value can be either a string or a number
Example of Union Types
Here’s a practical example:

typescript

Copy

function printId(id: number | string) {
    console.log(`Your ID is: ${id}`);
}

// Calling the function with different types
printId(123);        // Valid: number
printId("ABC123");   // Valid: string

Using Union Types in Interfaces
You can also use union types within interfaces:

typescript

Copy

interface User {
    id: number | string; // id can be a number or a string
    name: string;
}

const user1: User = { id: 1, name: "Alice" };
const user2: User = { id: "A123", name: "Bob" };

Type Guards with Union Types
You can use type guards to check the type of a union value:

typescript

Copy
function printId(id: number | string) {
    if (typeof id === "string") {
        console.log(`Your ID is a string: ${id}`);
    } else {
        console.log(`Your ID is a number: ${id}`);
    }
}

printId(42);          // Outputs: Your ID is a number: 42
printId("XYZ");       // Outputs: Your ID is a string: XYZ

Summary
Union types allow a variable to hold multiple types.
Defined using the pipe (|) symbol.
Useful for functions and interfaces to accept different types.
Type guards help in distinguishing between the types at runtime.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is Type Casting?
Type casting in TypeScript is a way to convert a variable from one type to another. 
It tells the compiler to treat a value as a different type, which can be useful 
when you're sure about the type but TypeScript doesn't recognize it.

Why Use Type Casting?
To access properties or methods of a specific type.
To handle values of any or unknown types more easily.
How to Use Type Casting
You can use two main methods for type casting:

Using as:
typescript

Copy
let value: unknown = "Hello";
let length: number = (value as string).length; // Treats value as a string
Using Angle Bracket Syntax:
typescript

Copy
let value: unknown = "Hello";
let length: number = (<string>value).length; // Also treats value as a string
Example
typescript

Copy
let someValue: any = 123;

// Cast someValue to a number
let numValue: number = someValue as number;

console.log(numValue); // Outputs: 123

Caution
No Runtime Checks: Type casting doesn’t change the actual type of the variable at runtime. 
If you cast incorrectly, it can lead to errors.
Use Carefully: Overusing type casting can lead to less safe and harder-to-maintain code.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Method Overloading in TypeScript
Method overloading in TypeScript allows a class to have multiple methods
with the same name but different parameter types or numbers. This enables
more flexible function calls while maintaining type safety.

How to Implement Method Overloading

Define Multiple Signatures: First, you define the different signatures for the method.
Implement the Method: Then, you provide a single implementation that handles all the cases.

Example
Here’s a simple example:

typescript

Copy
class Calculator {
    // Method overload signatures
    add(a: number, b: number): number; // Adding two numbers
    add(a: string, b: string): string; // Concatenating two strings

    // Implementation of the method
    add(a: number | string, b: number | string): number | string {
        if (typeof a === "number" && typeof b === "number") {
            return a + b; // Add numbers
        } else if (typeof a === "string" && typeof b === "string") {
            return a + b; // Concatenate strings
        }
        throw new Error("Invalid arguments");
    }
}

const calc = new Calculator();

console.log(calc.add(5, 10));      // Outputs: 15
console.log(calc.add("Hello, ", "World!")); // Outputs: Hello, World!
Key Points
Multiple Signatures: You can define multiple function signatures for different parameter types or counts.
Single Implementation: Only one implementation of the method is required, which must handle all defined signatures.
Type Safety: TypeScript ensures that the correct types are passed to the method based on the defined signatures.
Summary
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Lexical Scope in TypeScript.
Lexical scope refers to the visibility of variables based on their location within the source code. 
In TypeScript (and JavaScript), functions create their own scope. 
This means that a variable defined inside a function is not accessible outside of that function,
but it can access variables from its outer (enclosing) scope.

Key Points
Inner Functions: An inner function can access variables from its outer function.
No Access to Outer Variables: An outer function cannot access variables defined in its inner function.
Example
Here’s a simple example to illustrate lexical scope:

typescript

Copy
function outerFunction() {
    const outerVariable = "I'm from the outer function!";

    function innerFunction() {
        const innerVariable = "I'm from the inner function!";
        console.log(outerVariable); // Accessing outer variable
        console.log(innerVariable);  // Accessing inner variable
    }

    innerFunction(); // Call the inner function
    // console.log(innerVariable); // This would cause an error: innerVariable is not defined
}

outerFunction();
Explanation
outerFunction: Defines a variable outerVariable.
innerFunction: Can access outerVariable because it’s within the same scope.
Commented Line: If you try to access innerVariable from outerFunction, 
it results in an error because innerVariable is not defined in that scope.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Intersection Type in TypeScript
An intersection type in TypeScript allows you to combine multiple types into one. 
This means that a variable of an intersection type will have all the properties of the combined types. 
It is defined using the ampersand (&) symbol.

Key Points
Intersection types are useful for combining different types into a single type.
The resulting type will include all properties and methods from each type.
Example
Here’s a simple example to illustrate intersection types:

typescript

Copy
interface Person {
    name: string;
    age: number;
}

interface Employee {
    employeeId: number;
    department: string;
}

// Creating an intersection type
type EmployeeDetails = Person & Employee;

const employee: EmployeeDetails = {
    name: "Alice",
    age: 30,
    employeeId: 123,
    department: "Sales"
};

console.log(employee);
Explanation
Interfaces: We define two interfaces, Person and Employee, each with their own properties.
Intersection Type: The EmployeeDetails type is an intersection of Person and Employee, 
meaning it must include all properties from both.
Object Creation: The employee object includes properties from both interfaces, 
satisfying the intersection type.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Enum Type in TypeScript
An enum (short for "enumeration") in TypeScript is a special data type that allows
you to define a set of named constants. Enums make it easier to work with sets of related values,
improving code readability and maintainability.

Key Points
Enums can be numeric or string-based.
They provide a way to give friendly names to sets of numeric or string values.
Example of Numeric Enum
typescript

Copy
enum Direction {
    Up = 1,
    Down,
    Left,
    Right,
}

const move = Direction.Up; // move will have the value 1
console.log(move); // Outputs: 1
Example of String Enum
typescript

Copy
enum Color {
    Red = "RED",
    Green = "GREEN",
    Blue = "BLUE",
}

const favoriteColor = Color.Green; // favoriteColor will have the value "GREEN"
console.log(favoriteColor); // Outputs: GREEN
Explanation
Numeric Enum: Direction is an enum where Up is assigned the value 1, 
and the subsequent values automatically increment (i.e., Down is 2, Left is 3, and Right is 4).
String Enum: Color is an enum where each member is explicitly assigned a string value.
This helps in using meaningful names instead of ambiguous numeric values.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract Classes in TypeScript
An abstract class in TypeScript is a class that cannot be instantiated directly. 
It serves as a base class for other classes to extend. Abstract classes can include
both abstract methods (which must be implemented by derived classes) and
concrete methods (which have an implementation).

Key Points
Abstract classes are used to define common properties and methods that other classes can inherit.
They can contain abstract methods that must be implemented in derived classes.
Example
Here’s a simple example to illustrate abstract classes:

typescript

Copy
abstract class Animal {
    abstract makeSound(): void; // Abstract method

    move(): void { // Concrete method
        console.log("Animal moves");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    makeSound(): void { // Implementing the abstract method
        console.log("Woof!");
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    makeSound(): void { // Implementing the abstract method
        console.log("Meow!");
    }
}

const dog = new Dog();
dog.makeSound(); // Outputs: Woof!
dog.move();      // Outputs: Animal moves

const cat = new Cat();
cat.makeSound(); // Outputs: Meow!
cat.move();      // Outputs: Animal moves
Explanation
Abstract Class: The Animal class is declared as abstract and includes one abstract method (makeSound)
and one concrete method (move).
Derived Classes: Dog and Cat extend the Animal class and provide implementations for the makeSound method.
Instantiation: You cannot create an instance of Animal directly, but you can create instances of Dog and Cat.
----------------------------------------------------------------
Class Parameters in TypeScript
In TypeScript, class parameters refer to the parameters defined in a class constructor. 
These parameters are typically used to initialize the properties of a class 
when an instance of the class is created.

Key Points
Class parameters are defined in the constructor.
You can use access modifiers (public, private, protected) 
to automatically create properties based on constructor parameters.
Example
Here’s a simple example to illustrate class parameters:

typescript

Copy
class Person {
    // Properties
    name: string;
    age: number;

    // Constructor with parameters
    constructor(name: string, age: number) {
        this.name = name; // Initialize property
        this.age = age;   // Initialize property
    }

    // Method to display information
    displayInfo(): void {
        console.log(`Name: ${this.name}, Age: ${this.age}`);
    }
}

const person1 = new Person("Alice", 30);
person1.displayInfo(); // Outputs: Name: Alice, Age: 30
Using Access Modifiers
You can simplify property creation using access modifiers directly in the constructor:

typescript

Copy
class Employee {
    constructor(public name: string, public age: number, private employeeId: number) {}

    displayInfo(): void {
        console.log(`Name: ${this.name}, Age: ${this.age}, ID: ${this.employeeId}`);
    }
}

const employee1 = new Employee("Bob", 25, 101);
employee1.displayInfo(); // Outputs: Name: Bob, Age: 25, ID: 101

Explanation
Constructor: The constructor method is called when a new instance of the class is created. 
It takes parameters which are used to initialize class properties.
Access Modifiers: In the second example, public and private modifiers
allow you to declare properties directly in the constructor parameters.
public makes the property accessible outside the class, while private restricts 
access to within the class.

--------------------------------------------
Class in TypeScript
A class in TypeScript is a blueprint for creating objects.
 It encapsulates data (properties) and behavior (methods) 
 related to that data, enabling object-oriented programming.

Key Points
Classes can have properties and methods.
You can create multiple instances of a class.
TypeScript supports access modifiers (public, private, protected)
 to control access to class members.

Example
Here’s a simple example to illustrate a class in TypeScript:

typescript

Copy
class Car {
    // Properties
    make: string;
    model: string;
    year: number;

    // Constructor
    constructor(make: string, model: string, year: number) {
        this.make = make;
        this.model = model;
        this.year = year;
    }

    // Method to display car information
    displayInfo(): void {
        console.log(`Car: ${this.make} ${this.model}, Year: ${this.year}`);
    }
}

// Creating an instance of the Car class
const myCar = new Car("Toyota", "Corolla", 2021);
myCar.displayInfo(); // Outputs: Car: Toyota Corolla, Year: 2021
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Inheritance in TypeScript
Inheritance in TypeScript is a mechanism that allows one class (the derived class)
to inherit properties and methods from another class (the base class). 
This promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.

Key Points
A derived class can extend a base class using the extends keyword.
The derived class inherits all properties and methods of the base class
and can also have its own additional properties and methods.
You can override methods from the base class in the derived class.
Example
Here’s a simple example to illustrate inheritance in TypeScript:

typescript

Copy
// Base class
class Animal {
    constructor(public name: string) {}

    makeSound(): void {
        console.log(`${this.name} makes a sound.`);
    }
}

// Derived class
class Dog extends Animal {
    // Overriding the makeSound method
    makeSound(): void {
        console.log(`${this.name} barks.`);
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    // Overriding the makeSound method
    makeSound(): void {
        console.log(`${this.name} meows.`);
    }
}

// Creating instances
const dog = new Dog("Buddy");
const cat = new Cat("Whiskers");

dog.makeSound(); // Outputs: Buddy barks.
cat.makeSound(); // Outputs: Whiskers meows.
Explanation
Base Class: The Animal class has a constructor that sets 
the name property and a makeSound method that outputs a generic sound message.
Derived Classes: The Dog and Cat classes extend the Animal class. 
They inherit the name property and the makeSound method but provide 
their own implementations of makeSound, overriding the base class method.
Instance Creation: Instances of Dog and Cat are created, and their respective
makeSound methods are called, demonstrating polymorphism.
